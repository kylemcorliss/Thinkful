DRILL:

Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

RESPONSE:

First, we need to assume for the people data we have, we have some sort of measure whether they pay their bills on time. The best dataset would be purchases aggregated monthly with a binary metric of paid their bills or not by month as well. 

I would use KNN to create similar groups in terms of purchasing, how much of a % of total spending do they spend on each of the 4 categories. This profile would then be used to predict the outcome of whether that similar group pays their bills on time. If we had the monthly data, we could then use KNN regression to predict what % of the time they pay their bills as well. Being able to choose the number of neighbors  would be helpful in order to fine-tune or groups of similarity. Depending on what I see in the data, I could separate large, disparate groups into more granular groups that might increase the accuracy of the model.
